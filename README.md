# Roblox Homepage Cleaner

This extension allows you to hide parts of the roblox homepage to make it look cleaner.

Currently, this extension only works with Firefox.

## Installation

To install the extension, it can be tested with Firefox's [about:debugging](about:debugging) page. This will only be temporary and will disappear when the browser closes.

There is currently no extension page for it yet, and installing it properly requires either [Firefox Developer Edition](https://www.firefox.com/en-US/channel/desktop/developer/) or changing <u>xpinstall.signatures.required</u> in [about:config](about:config). Modifying this in the config is not recommended due to the security risk.
